# Lab | Good Practices

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to define good practices that you and your team will follow during your third project.

## Instructions
* Fork this repo. 
* Debate about your code styling with your team.
* Do some agreements on the topics below.
* Create a `.md` file that describes the good practices you defined. Add the file to your repository and submit it by doing a pull request.  
* Follow your agreements during the project!

## Topics
FOLLOW PEP8 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! 

* Variable naming.
    - Snake Case for most varibales
    - max length of 79 characters
    - Camel Case for constants and 
    - for SQL and longer codes: use line breaks appropiately to keep clean code, align the lines 
        
        *eg: """ CREATE TABLE hello(
        
                    id INT,
                    
                    name VARCHAR(255)
                    
                    );
    
        *eg: income = (gross_wages +
        
                      taxable_interest +
                      
                      (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
                      
                      ira_deduction -
                      
                      student_loan_interest)
* Function naming.
    - use verb in name to describe functions
* Libraries.
    - import librabries used in class
    - save def funcitons separately insead of repeating and import those files to call on funcitons

* Community conventions.
    - PEP 8

* Other (git, ...)
    - Work from one repo, clone it and branch if needed to work on group changes. 
    - For individual tasks work on master BUT USE SUMMARY AND DESCRIPTION CLEARLY.
    - Push every time you finish a section of code.
